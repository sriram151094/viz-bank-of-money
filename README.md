# Problem description

Mini-Challenge 2: Bank of Money Regional Office Network Operations Forensics
During a time period that is NOT overlapping with MC 1, a Region within the Bank of Money is experiencing operational difficulties. This becomes a challenge for the operations staff, particularly as they attempt to deploy their limited number of skilled administrators to address issues occurring in the enterprise.

You will be provided with Firewall and IDS logs from one of the BOM networks of approximately 5000 machines. These are very similar to the Firewall and IDS logs you worked on during the VAST 2011 MC 2, and so the tools you used there will come in handy for this mini-challenge (and reuse is encouraged). You will also be provided with a description of the network to guide your investigation.

MC 2.1 Using your visual analytics tools, can you identify what noteworthy events took place for the time period covered in the firewall and IDS logs? Provide screen shots of your visual analytics tools that highlight the five most noteworthy events of security concern, along with explanations of each event.

MC 2.2 What security trend is apparent in the firewall and IDS logs over the course of the two days included here? Illustrate the identified trend with an informative and innovative visualization.
